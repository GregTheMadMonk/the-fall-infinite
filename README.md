# The Fall: Infinite

[The demo is available on Itch.io](https://gregthemadmonk.itch.io/the-fall-infinite)

The Fall: Infinite is an interactive demo inspired by [The Fall](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrPApgp-aa4) video by ps1nk4.
The idea is to provide user with theoretically infinite amount of content instead of current de facto standart of 10 hours.
Sadly, I couldn't recognize all sound effects present in the original video, so if you know which are missing, you're welcome to tell me or contribute to the project yourself.

Project uses Godot engine.
